Hello, world!

My name is Olivia Ross.
I am pursuing my Master of Data Science with a concentration in Business Intelligence and Analytics. 

In 2021, I earned my Master of Public Health with a concentration in epidemiology. I currently work in clinical research as a regulatory and recruiting specialist, and work to present data associated with both aspects to my team in an easy, yet meaningful way.
